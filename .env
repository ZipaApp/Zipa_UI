# Environment variables for local development of Zipa_UI
# Default: point to localhost where the API Gateway may be exposed.
# If you run the UI inside Docker Compose, uncomment the api-gateway line below.

# Use this when running Nuxt dev on your host and the gateway is reachable at localhost:5000
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:5000

# OR: when running the UI inside Docker Compose, use the service name:
# NUXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL=http://api-gateway:5000

# Leave empty to use API Gateway for all requests including static files
# The inventory service is not exposed to the browser (only to Docker network)
# so images must be served through the API Gateway
NUXT_PUBLIC_INVENTORY_API_BASE_URL=

# Optional: direct auth service (leave empty to use gateway)
NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=

# Dev server settings (adjust if needed)
NUXT_HOST=0.0.0.0
NUXT_PORT=3100
