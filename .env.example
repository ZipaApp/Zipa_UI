# Example environment variables for ZIPA_UI
# Set these in your root `docker-compose.yml` for the UI service or in your host environment.

# URL of the API Gateway (this is the primary endpoint the UI should call)
# Use the docker-compose service name `api-gateway` so the UI inside Docker
# can reach the gateway. Adjust when running the UI outside Docker.
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL=http://api-gateway:5000

# URL of the Auth service (if the UI needs to talk directly to Auth)
# When running inside Docker Compose use the service name `auth-api`.
NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://auth-api:3000

# URL of the Inventory microservice (direct or via gateway)
# By default the UI will fall back to the API Gateway URL if this is unset.
NUXT_PUBLIC_INVENTORY_API_BASE_URL=http://api-gateway:5000

# Optional: set host/port for preview
NUXT_HOST=0.0.0.0
NUXT_PORT=3100
